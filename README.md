# StockXSneakers

Using the StockX API available at https://stockx.com/api/browse?page=1&productCategory=sneakers

As of now the point of this repo is to provide a dataset with all sneakers that are available StockX.
Explorations and insights into this data are soon to come.

Inspiration from my web scraping experiments found in https://github.com/ReubenMathew/DataOpsExperiments
